This repository provides a template for building APIs in Kotlin. It uses Ktor for server setup and Smiley4 for Swagger documentation. Authentication is managed through OAuth2 with JWT validation, and the template is designed to allow easy customization for advanced validation and authorization needs.

Included in the project is a basic controller for users, using in-memory data to facilitate testing with Swagger.
